Overview
The DNA Sequence Assembly project focuses on reconstructing a DNA sequence from smaller fragments using various algorithms to handle overlaps and ensure correctness. This project aims to address the computational problem of sequence assembly in bioinformatics, where DNA sequences are reconstructed from a set of fragmented sequences.

Project Features
Overlap Handling: Efficiently manages overlaps between DNA fragments to reconstruct the original sequence.
Error Handling: Handles common and edge cases in DNA sequence assembly to ensure robustness.
Testing: Comprehensive testing suite to validate the correctness and efficiency of the sequence assembly process.

Project Structure
src/: Contains the source code for the DNA sequence assembly algorithms.
tests/: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of the project.
docs/: Documentation and instructions related to the project.
README.md: This file.

Working
Input: A set of DNA fragments that need to be assembled into a complete sequence.
Processing: The algorithm identifies overlaps between fragments and assembles them into the longest possible sequence.
Output: A complete DNA sequence reconstructed from the provided fragments.
